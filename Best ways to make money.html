                <img src="pngs/big images/casino_heist.png" alt="casino heist GTA 5">
                <h5>
                    If the casino heist is done well it can give about an average of $ 100,000 per mission to the host (1M - 1.5M), <br>
                    this is done by starting the heist with 2 good hackers (you can traine in the arcade). The best <br>
                    target for 2 players is the: <br>
                    <br>
                    1. Diamond: $3,290,000-$3,619,000 (Events Only)<br>
                    2. Artwork: $2,350,000-$2,585,000<br>
                    3. Gold: $2,585,000-$2,843,500<br>
                    4. Cash: $2,115,000-$2,326,500<br>
                    <br>
                    The Artwork is higher on the list because it's easier to get all the paintings Then to get all of the Gold or Cash. <br>
                    If done fast the heist can give about an average of $750,000 to $1,000,000 an hour. <br>

                <img src="pngs/big images/cayo_perico.png" alt="cayo perico GTA 5">
                <h5>
                    Alot of times the cayo perico heist is said to be the best legit form of making money, <br>
                    but it looks like rockstar heard this and now the cayo perico heist has a cooldown of <br>
                    one GTA day (48 minutes irl), but if the cayo perico heist is done solo the cooldown extends <br>
                    to three GTA days (144 minutes irl) making the cayo perico heist alot worse. <br>

                <img src="pngs/big images/hangar.png" alt="GTA hangar">
                <h5>
                    If made with 4 players the Hangar missions give $120,000/mission, if made with a good <br>
                    crew the Hangar missions are realy fast and can get you up to $720,000 an hour. <br>
                    All of the missions are the same difficulty.

                <img src="pngs/big images/doomsday_heist.png" alt="doomsday heist GTA">
                <h5>
                    The Doomsday Heist is known to be the hardest heist in the game, <br>
                    and we don't say that it's not true but there are alot of ways to <br>
                    make it easier on yourself like:
                    If you finished the Doomsday Scenario it's better to replay the first <br>
                    heist because it has easier preps, less preps and fastest to finish.
                </h5>
                5. Vehicle Cargo $300,000-$450,000/hour <br>
                <br>
                <img src="pngs/big images/vehicle_cargo.png" alt="GTA Vehicle warehouse">
                <h5>
                    Vehicle Cargo is one of the best ways to make money although it's not <br>
                    very recommended, it's harder then the better ways and you need alot of <br>
                    money to start, this and the combination of toxic players. The Hangar <br>
                    Missions are way easier and better paying then the Vehicle Cargo.
